Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Resnet: "beagle", AlexNet: "beagle", VGG: "english foxhound". So, no, VGG got it wrong.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes. But VGG kept consistently classifying it as "english foxhound".


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: ResNet and VGG yes. AlexNet got the Black_bear_01.jpg wrong, classifying it as "chimpanzee"


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: ResNet on the uploaded pictures. Got everything right.

Final Results:
While ResNet performed the best for my uploaded images, VGG performed better on the dataset provided.
It achieved 100% accuracy for dog identification, and 93.3% accuracy in breed classification.
